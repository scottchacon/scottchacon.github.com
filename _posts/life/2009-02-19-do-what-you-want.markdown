title: Do What You Want
---

My friend Chris Wanstrath gave the [keynote talk](http://gist.github.com/67060) yesterday at StartupRiot on his lessons learned in building a successful startup company.  A comment on the [Hacker News](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=487686) post about it summed the keynote up thusly:

> dont be afraid to fail, there is lots to learn from it, follow what you 
> genuinely love and use, and do what works for you best

I largely agree, and I like the talk.  What I wanted to comment on was what I read on the same Hacker News post:

> I know that's a popular piece of advice given around here (though HN has 
> an interesting mix of "stuffy" academia and "Wild West" hacker culture), 
> and I felt the same way when I was younger. I thought I knew all the CS 
> I needed to know to develop the stuff I'd want to develop. But I want to

That commenter was talking about a part at the end of Chris's talk where 
he mentions a kid that was trying to decide if he should go to college to
learn CS or just work at a startup.  Chris's advice is to :

> Do whatever you want.
> Don’t take VC because Twitter did. Don’t piss off investors because 
> signals likes to. Do whatever you want, whatever works best for you, what 
> makes you the most comfortable and seems like the best idea. 
> Do what you love.

I love the advice to not do what others did just because that is what is done, but I would probably advise that guy to go to college.  Not because it's the only way to get things done, but because it's a great way to get a broader perspective.  I've found that the better programmers I know are people that have interests in things other than programming.  I discovered tons of things that I would not have normally been interested in but made me think differently because of classes I took in college.
