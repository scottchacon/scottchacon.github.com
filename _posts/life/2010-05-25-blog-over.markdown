title: My New Blog
---

My previous blog, which moved from host to host, domain to domain over the years
has built up a lot of cruft.  I believe I went from a Ruby blog to WordPress to
a custom blog engine back to WordPress to Jekyll and it's a mess.  Plus, a lot
of the stuff I used to blog about is not really relevant to me anymore and the
domain name I did everything under, "jointheconversation.org", was too long and
not as relevant to what I'm doing as it used to be.

So, I've decided to declare blog bankruptcy - blogruptcy - and start over again
with a new site design (this time done by me, as you can probably tell) and 
new content.  I pulled over a few of the last entries of my previous blog but 
for the most part I'm starting over.

So there.
